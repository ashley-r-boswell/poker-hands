## Building
Use an IDE with a Maven plugin in order to get the dependencies. To run the UI from your IDE, run PokerHandsApplication from package com.pokerhands.ui. Alternatively, if you run a Maven build on the pom.xml (with goal = package) it will create a jar under the /targets directory with all of the dependencies included.

## Testing
Use an IDE with Maven and do a Maven build on the pom.xml (with goal = test or package). This will build and run the unit tests. Alternatively, if your IDE has JUnit, you can run the tests under PokerHands/src/test.
